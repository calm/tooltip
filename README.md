# DEPRECATED

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

The tooltip that has all the right moves.

It handles the gross complexity of view hierarchies and scroll view offsets.  You just tell it which view to point at it'll do the rest!  It'll even follow that view around the screen as it moves, re-shifting itself and its arrow to stay within the bounds of the window (or another superview you specify).  Highly configurable yet super simple out-of-the-box.

## Installation

Add `pod 'SexyTooltip'` to your `Podfile` or download the source [here](https://github.com/calm/SexyTooltip/releases)

## Creation

The default initializer is to give the tooltip a content view which will be contained within the tooltip.

```objc
SexyTooltip *errorTooltip = [[SexyTooltip alloc] initWithContentView:self.errorLabel];
```

`SexyTooltip` can also be created with an `NSAttributedString`, which will create a UILabel as the tooltip's content view.

```objc
SexyTooltip *greetingsTooltip = [[SexyTooltip alloc] initWithAttributedString:greetingsText
                                                                sizedToView:self.view
                                                                withPadding:UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 5, 10, 5)
                                                                  andMargin:UIEdgeInsetsMake(20, 20, 20, 20)];
[self.view addSubview:greetingsTooltip];
```

## Presentation

The true beauty of SexyTooltip shines once you present it.  No more dealing with nested CGRect logic and UIScrollView offsets.  Just pass the view that you want the tooltip to point at, and even as that view moves around the SexyTooltip will continue pointing at the `fromView` (see the example video above)

```objc
[greetingsTooltip presentFromView:self.loginButton
                           inView:self.view
                       withMargin:10
                         animated:YES];
```

You can also present from a rect or point.

If you use a `present` method that doesn't explicitly pass `inView`, the `fromView`'s direct superview will be used as the `inView`. The `inView`'s `bounds.size` must be larger (`width` and `height`) than the ultimate `bounds.size` of the tooltip, otherwise there will be no way to place the tooltip.

## Dismissal

Dismissal is as easy as calling `-(void)dismiss;` which defaults to animated dismissal.  There's always `[self.tooltip dismissAnimated:NO];` if you want to suck all of the joy out of your app ;)

Additionally, you can do `[self.tooltip dismissInTimeInterval:10];` if you'd like to keep 'er showing for 10 seconds.  Any other dismissals will cancel this timer, or you can do so yourself with `[self.tooltip cancelDismissTimer];`

Your tooltip will also be dismissed when it is tapped.

## Appearance

The default is a nice white with a subtle shadow and curved corners.  You can change everything from `hasShadow` to `arrowMargin` to `borderColor` to `padding` to `arrowHeight` etc.  All of these methods will maintain where your tooltip is currently pointing if they're called while it's showing.

## Arrow direction

You can specify an array of `permittedArrowDirections` which specify the preference order of pointing directions.  The tooltip will attempt to fit itself inside the `inView` you passed while maintaining the arrow pointing at the target view or point.  For example, if you're pointing at a view that's moving around the screen, SexyTooltip will continue to be visible as the view moves to the edges by changing its direction in order to stay within the bounds of the `inView`.  This is very powerful for complex tooltip scenarios or cases where you're not sure how the interface might look at the moment of presentation (e.g. variable text sizes)

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, SexyTooltipArrowDirection) {
    SexyTooltipArrowDirectionUp,
    SexyTooltipArrowDirectionDown,
    SexyTooltipArrowDirectionLeft,
    SexyTooltipArrowDirectionRight
};
```

## Delegate

You can optionally hear about any of the following events as the delegate of your tooltip

```objc
@protocol SexyTooltipDelegate <NSObject>

@optional
- (void)tooltipDidPresent:(SexyTooltip *)tooltip;
- (void)tooltipDidDismiss:(SexyTooltip *)tooltip;
- (void)tooltipWillBeTapped:(SexyTooltip *)tooltip;
- (void)tooltipWasTapped:(SexyTooltip *)tooltip;

@end
```
